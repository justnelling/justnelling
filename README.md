### Hi there 👋
---
+ ❤️‍🔥 My name is Lionel Deng.
+
+ ⚡ I am a Python developer with fullstack experience who is actively transitioning into AI engineering.
+ 🌱 With a background in webdev, data science, and Python, I am currently building AI SAAS products of my own. I'm excited by the applications of vector embeddings and LLMs for perfect recall (never lose an idea), idea networking (proliferate that idea) and digital knowledge twins (a digital agent tailored to iterate and execute ideas) based on users' online histories, prompts and improved tool use.
+ 🔭 I believe we are on the cusp of the greatest digital revolution and I am devoted to learning all I can about the coming Intelligence Age, powered by neural networks and transformers.

+ 💭 Ask me anything! [Get in touch](https://linktr.ee/lionel.deng)
